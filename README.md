# Get high or die: a classification of poisonous mushrooms

This was an assignment for Utrecht University's Supervised Learning and Visualisation course (https://www.gerkovink.com/slv/). We aimed to create a classifier to determine whether a mushroom was poisonous or edible.

This project was conducted in a team of 4, in which all members contributed to the final report. The analyses were split based on the members' models of predilection.

This was the team members' first venture into true collaboration on GitHub; for this reason, it may be difficult to trace back the evolution of specific files or individual members' contribution. The repository as present contains the final analysis files, as well as notes from the first meeting to illustrate our teamworking and organisational abilities.
