AIM
- to create an app classifying mushrooms for hikers
- we want to cater to different interests: an app, and printed out stuff.
  We will find the best models for this and see what works "well enough" for hikers

PRIORITIES
- beginner models
- advanced is if we have time afterwards - are they better, how much better?

PREDICTORS (determined from meeting on 26/10)
- full set: nonconverging for GLM
- handle missing predictors
- what's observable for hikers?
	cap shape   	- beginner
	cap surface 	- advanced
	cap color   	- beginner - collapse brown & cinnamon & buff, pink & purple & red
		    	- advanced - as originally
	bruises     	- beginner
	odor        	- advanced
	gill 		- advanced
	gill color      - beginner - collapse brown & buff & chocolate, pink & purple & red
	stalk shape	- beginner
	stalk root	- advanced
	stalk surface	- advanced
	stalk color	- advanced?
	veil type	- excluded
	veil color	- advanced
	ring number	- beginner
	ring type	- advanced
	spore print	- advanced
	population	- beginner - collapse into loner/with friends
	habitat		- beginner - collapse meadows & grass, leaves & woods, paths & urban
	

MODELS
- Florian & Christoph: logistic regression
- Judith & Alex:       trees

HOW WE EVALUATE MODELS
- Christoph has some functions - has AUC for logreg
- Alex wants to look into calibration

TODO
- Preprocess data: Alex
	- recoding
	- beginner dataset
	- advanced dataset
	- train dataset
	- test dataset
- Fit beginner models & see if we can have less predictors
	Meeting about this 02/11 after class
